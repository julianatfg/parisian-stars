I was supposed to be reading a book but I’m not, so here goes something. Like I said some other day, I miss blogging and, more importantly, I miss writing about my hobbies and obsessions. Last Sunday, I just finished watching the latest series of **Doctor Who** (like the rest of the world) but I didn’t utter a single word in public about it. That would be unheard-of at the height of my fandom years.

ANYWAY. I’m here to say I’m definitely, *head over heels*, obsessed with Harry Styles. Look, I’ve known of him for years, I’ve listened to Sign of the Times over the radio an infinite number of times (alô JBFM, que sempre toca as mesmas músicas no mesmo horário), I just hadn’t paid attention to the music so far. But then, by December, he’d released **“Fine Line”** and people started talking, like it was the best indie pop album of ALL TIMES, and I’m thinking, “heyyyy, I’m interested. Should I listen to it? Okay, I shall.” I did and I immediately looooooved what I heard, especially “Cherry”, at which point I’m questioning my most musically-inclined friends on Twitter about who they think that song reminds them of (a bit Magnetic Fields with vocals by Sufjan Stevens, we’ve established). Then, as I was relaying this all to Fiona, she was like, WATCH THE ADORE YOU VIDEO RIGHT NOW. And, oh boy, I did:

😍😍😍

Heart eyes all around, amirite? It was all downhill from there. That month, I also took a holiday so I just listened to Fine Line on repeat by the pool. Very summery. I swear I’ll always link those two things in my mind: Harry Styles and my end-of-year holidays ’19. You know how Sparks go “the olfactory sense is the sense that most strongly evokes memories of the past” in Perfume? Well, it is closely followed by the hearing sense for me.

So, all this time I’ve been kept busy by various other appearances and videos uploaded on YouTube. I’m just going to dump my favourites here without further explanation, because I don’t need to.
