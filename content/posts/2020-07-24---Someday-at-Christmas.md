Back in April, at the start of this *fucking pandemic*, I bought a Kindle Paperwhite because a) I mostly read at night, in bed; b) my old Kindle didn’t have a backlight; and c) WHY THE HELL NOT?

So, the result was simply that I have never so much in my entire life, and for so long, without virtually any breaks in between books — fine, maybe I didn’t also have breaks whilst I read “A Song of Ice and Fire” but that’s another situation entirely. We’re talking here of STANDALONE BOOKS!! *_cries with joy_*

I’m fucking elated, you guys.

Naturally, and as I’m still on Netgalley and happily they haven’t kicked me out yet, on Monday I was approved to read & review [“Someday at Christmas”](https://www.netgalley.co.uk/catalog/book/198062) by Lizzie Byron. Which took me, like, 3 days to read. I basically never read that fast but this was the greatest Christmas romp you’ll ever see these days.

Also, the cover is SO cute!

The story goes something like this: Shell Smith works at an old-fashioned department store, Duke & Sons, on the counter for ART, a make-up brand, and she’s bangin’ at her job! She’s confident, has the LOVELIEST family, has an old crush on a indie scoundrel (hey, who hasn’t been there?) that comes back to haunt her, and has managed, in the meantime, to accumulate a most fabulous band of friends, who are as warm-hearted and diverse as one would’ve hoped.

There’s a LOT of shop-floor gossip, which is much like any real life workplace, and just at the beginning there are changes afoot: there’s a Dapper Suited Stranger who’s possibly trying to ruin it all and close up shop, but is he really?

There are loads others tropes which are amongst some of my favourites but it has to be said that Friends to Lovers is one of the best — rivalled only by the second best which is Enemies to Lovers, amirite?

Anyway, I shan’t say anymore for fear of spoiling things as I’m wont to do, so, suffice to say I enjoyed every minute of it! GO READ!
